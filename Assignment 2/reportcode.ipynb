The dataset will be splitted into two sets; training set which will be used to learn model and create the tree, the test set which will be used to measure the success of our learned model.

    "After the pruning process we see that the model keeps the metrics around the same value or slightly better compare to the normal tree. The tree's computation time also also decreased with pruning operation. As we prune the tree more since it gets less deep, the run time for predictions will decrease while doing the same amount of correct predictions. At the same time, since the nodes that are not used, are deleted, it improves the space efficiency as well. It also solves the problem with overfitting the data with reducing our conjuctions in our rules."
