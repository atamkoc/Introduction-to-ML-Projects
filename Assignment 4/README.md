This is the repository for the 4rd Assignment.

Our goals for this assignment were:

-Classifying vegetable images using Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks

-Part 1: Implementing a Multi Layer Neural Network for image classification with different activation functions. Relu, sigmoid, tanh and softmax.

-Part 1: Implementing forward and backward propagation functions with the loss function and the learning rate. 

-Part 1: Implementing a function to minimize your cost function using mini-batch gradient descent. And testing which learning rates and batch sizes work the best for our NN.

-Part 1: Optimizing the NN using the functions we have implemented in previous steps.




-Part 2: Classfying images using PyTorch and Convolutional Neural Networks.

-Part 2: Finetuning the weights of all layers.

-Part 2: Learning how to use and optimize VGG-19 model for image classification
