This is the repo for the 3rd Assignment.

Our goals for this assignment were:

-Classifying News Articles according to their categories using Naive Bayes Algorithm
-Implementing our own Naive Bayes algorithm without using any other external libraries
-Implementing Bag of Words with Unigram and Bigram options
-Analyzing effect of the words on prediction
-Listing the top n words whose presence most strongly predicts that the article belongs to specific category for each five categories.
-Listing the 10 words whose absence most strongly predicts that the article
belongs to specific category for each five categories.


Dataset can also be found in this repo under "English Dataset.csv"

Our observations and other additional comments can be found under .ipynb files for each part of the project
